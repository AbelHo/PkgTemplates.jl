# When this Julia package is copied into the Docker image if the resulting package is a
# clean git repo on an untracked branch (a branch with no associated remote branch) then
# Julia will error when trying to run `Pkg.update`. This problem can be solved by either
# making a tracked branch (hard) or making the git repo dirty (easy).
#
# If we exclude any committed file then this repo will be dirty inside of the Docker image.

# Ignore dependencies that are built/retrieved. Note that copying binary dependencies is
# brittle as these packages may break due to differences in operating system versions,
# build environments, and/or absolute path dependencies. Be sure to add required build
# files within "deps" directory to the exception list below.
